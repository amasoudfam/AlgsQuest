This repository contains codes from Machine Learning, Data Science, and Algorithms, which are explained on [AlgsQuest YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AlgsQuest)  or [algorithmha.ir](http://www.algorithmha.ir)
. You can also help me improve or develop these codes. :)

* ### [Philosophy of ROC Curve & AUC](https://github.com/amasoudfam/AlgsQuest/blob/main/Philosophy_of_ROC_Curve_%26_AUC.ipynb)

    The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve visually displays how well a classification model distinguishes between classes, and AUC (Area Under the Curve) is a numerical measure derived from the ROC curve, summarizing the model's overall performance.
